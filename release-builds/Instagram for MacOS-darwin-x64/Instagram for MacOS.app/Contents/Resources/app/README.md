A simple application that will allow you to easily look at your Instagram account while working with Mac. 💻

I actually prepared this application to meet my own need. I had to look at the phone every time to look at Instagram comments and messages (Direct). And when I picked up the phone, I was distracted. 📱😬

It has all the features in the mobile web version of Instagram.
